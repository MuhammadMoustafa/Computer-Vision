# Notes

## You may check task1 folder 
#### It is a simplified gui to apply some image processing techniques ... you may find some errors and the non implemented function histogram equalization ... But I will work on it ISA

## As for point 5 in task 4
#### Homogeneaous areas have 
#### a window mean that is close to the picel mean
#### a relatively small standard deviation
#### a histogram that has a peak around the pixel intensity value
